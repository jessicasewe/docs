## Bearer Token Authentication

Zeepay’s API follows a secure authentication model where **Bearer tokens** are used to validate and authorize every request made to our endpoints. The token must be included in the **Authorization** header of each request, ensuring that only authorized clients can access our services.

Unlike public keys, which are used for client-side operations, Bearer tokens are generated using **private credentials**. These tokens are highly sensitive and should be treated as secret keys. It is crucial to **store tokens securely** to avoid unauthorized access. If you suspect a token has been compromised, you can easily regenerate it through the authentication process.

### Best Practices:

- **Store Tokens Securely**: Never expose tokens in client-side code or version control systems.
- **Use Environment Variables**: For both the test and production environment, store sensitive tokens in environment variables.
- **Regenerate Tokens**: If a token is compromised, immediately regenerate it via your authentication system.

<Note>
  Always keep API keys and user credentials safe. Never expose them in the
  front-end code or any publicly accessible repositories.
</Note>

### Authorization Format

To authenticate API requests, include the token in the `Authorization` header in the following format:

<Info>**Authorization**: Bearer `your_token_here`</Info>

#### Sample Authorization Header:

<Tip>
  Authorization: Bearer
  e1f2g3h4i5j6k7l8m9n0o1p2q3r4s5t6u7v8w9x0y1z2a3b4c5d6fvjfbedjscyhs
</Tip>

### Response on Missing or Invalid Authentication

If a request is made without an Authorization token or with an invalid token, you will receive the following response:

<Info>
  **401: Unauthorized** You must provide a valid Bearer token in the
  Authorization header to access the API.
</Info>

### Secure API Requests

All API requests must be made over HTTPS to ensure data privacy and integrity during transmission. Ensure that your application enforces HTTPS for all interactions with Zeepay’s API.

### Token Expiration and Regeneration

Tokens are typically valid for a limited period to enhance security. Once a token expires, you will need to regenerate it using your credentials. This process is designed to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

<Note>
  Regularly check your token’s expiration date and implement an automatic
  refresh strategy where possible.
