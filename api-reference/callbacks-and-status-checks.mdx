## Overview

Zeepay provides two methods for retrieving transaction statuses:

1. **Callbacks**: Automatically notify your application of the transaction's outcome.
2. **Status Check Endpoint**: Allows you to manually poll the status of a transaction.

These options ensure flexibility in integrating transaction tracking into your application.

## Callbacks

When making a transaction request (e.g., Credit, Debit, or Cash Pick), you can include an optional `callback_url` parameter in the request body.

### Callback Behavior

- **What We Send:** Zeepay will send a POST request to the `callback_url` with the transaction status once it is processed.
- **Statuses Sent via Callback:**
  - `success`
  - `failed`
- **Statuses Not Sent via Callback:**
  - `pending` transactions will not trigger a callback. Use the **Status Check Endpoint** to monitor pending transactions.

### Example Callback Request

Hereâ€™s what Zeepay sends to your `callback_url`:

```json
{
  "transaction_id": "12345",
  "status": "success",
  "amount": "100.00",
  "currency": "USD",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-30T12:00:00Z"
}
```
