description: "Learn how to retrieve transaction statuses via callbacks or the status check endpoint."
---

## Overview

Zeepay provides two methods for retrieving transaction statuses:

1. **Callbacks**: Automatically notify your application of the transaction's outcome.
2. **Status Check Endpoint**: Allows you to manually poll the status of a transaction.

These options ensure flexibility in integrating transaction tracking into your application.

## Callbacks

When making a transaction request (e.g., Credit, Debit, or Cash Pick), you can include an optional `callback_url` parameter in the request body.

### Callback Behavior

- **What We Send:** Zeepay will send a POST request to the `callback_url` with the transaction status once it is processed.
- **Statuses Sent via Callback:**
  - `success`
  - `failed`
- **Statuses Not Sent via Callback:**
  - `pending` transactions will not trigger a callback. Use the **Status Check Endpoint** to monitor pending transactions.

### Example Callback Request

Hereâ€™s what Zeepay sends to your `callback_url`:

```json
{
  "zeepay_id": 12345,
  "reference": "RSN230130A45B7",
  "status": "Success",
  "code": 200,
  "message": "Transaction Successful",
  "gateway_id": null
}
```

```json
{
  "zeepay_id": 12345,
  "reference": "RSN230130A45B7",
  "status": "Error",
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Failed At Payment Gateway",
  "gateway_id": 76345648297
}
```
