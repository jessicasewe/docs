## HTTP Error Codes

The following are common HTTP status codes you might encounter when interacting with Zeepayâ€™s API, along with descriptions of what they mean and suggested actions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="103 - Wallet Balance Ceiling Breach" stepNumber="ðŸ“Œ">
    **Action Required**: No immediate action is needed from your side. However,
    this indicates that the transaction cannot proceed due to the recipientâ€™s
    wallet balance exceeding its ceiling limit.
  </Step>

{" "}

<Step title="200 - Validated Success" stepNumber="ðŸ“Œ">
  **Action Required**: None. The request was successful. The wallet exists, and
  you can proceed with the transaction. For charge or verify requests, check the
  data object to determine if the transaction was successful or failed.
</Step>

{" "}

<Step title="400 - Bad Request" stepNumber="ðŸ“Œ">
  **Action Required**: This error indicates that the request is malformed or
  missing required parameters. Double-check the format and the required fields
  of the request. Ensure that all required parameters are provided and correctly
  formatted.
</Step>

{" "}

<Step title="401 - Unauthorized" stepNumber="ðŸ“Œ">
  **Action Required**: This error occurs when the request lacks valid
  authentication. Make sure that a valid Bearer token is included in the
  Authorization header. If the token is missing or incorrect, regenerate the
  token and try again.
</Step>

{" "}

<Step title="402 - Client Payment Required" stepNumber="ðŸ“Œ">

  review the balance and contact Zeepay for further assistance or resolve
  payment issues.
</Step>

{" "}

<Step title="403 - Forbidden" stepNumber="ðŸ“Œ">
  **Action Required**: You are attempting to access a restricted Zeepay
  resource. This resource is only accessible to users with admin privileges. If
  you believe this is an error, contact your system administrator or Zeepay
  support.
</Step>

{" "}

<Step title="404 - Not Found" stepNumber="ðŸ“Œ">

  the resource exists.
</Step>

{" "}

<Step title="405 - Method Not Allowed" stepNumber="ðŸ“Œ">

  HTTP method (e.g., POST instead of GET). Check the API documentation for the
  correct method and try again.
</Step>

{" "}

<Step title="406 - Not Acceptable" stepNumber="ðŸ“Œ">
  **Action Required**: The request format is not supported. Only JSON is
  accepted by Zeepayâ€™s API. Ensure your request headers specify the correct
  content type (`application/json`).
</Step>

{" "}

<Step title="410 - Gone" stepNumber="ðŸ“Œ">

  availability or consult the API documentation for updates.

  processed and is pending on Zeepayâ€™s servers. No action is needed from you,
  but keep checking the status of the request.
</Step>

{" "}

<Step title="419 - Sanctions/OFAC List Breach" stepNumber="ðŸ“Œ">

  cannot receive funds. No action is needed from you, but this situation
  requires compliance with regulations.
</Step>

{" "}

<Step title="429 - Too Many Requests" stepNumber="ðŸ“Œ">
  **Action Required**: You are making too many requests in a short period. This

    **Action Required**: Zeepayâ€™s API is temporarily unavailable due to
